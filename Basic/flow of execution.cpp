//control structures of cpp

/* structure refers to the flow of execution of program.
   There are basically three types of control structures:
   1. sequence structure: executes line by line
   2. selection structure: checks condition for true or false
      & gives final output
   3. loop structure: checks for condition gives output then
      again goes for loop check until the condition stops 
      satisfying.
