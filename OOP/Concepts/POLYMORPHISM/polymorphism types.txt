Polymorphism is the ability to express a message in more than one form.

Example 1: operator "+":
    - mathematically, 3 + 4 = 7
    - in string, hello + bye = hellobye
Example 2: operator *
    - mathematically, 3 * 4 = 12
    - in string, tall * 3 = tall tall tall

There are two types of polymorphism:
1. Compile time polymorphism OR Early Binding
    - Function overloading
    - Operator overloading
2. Run time polymorphism
    - Virtual Function
