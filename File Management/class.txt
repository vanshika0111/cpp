The header file used in cpp for file management is fstream.h
It is inheritted from iostream.h only but is more widely used.

It has three components:
    1. ifstream: class ties a file to the program for input
    2. ofstream: class ties a file to the pr(ogram for output
    3. fstream:  class ties a file to the program for both input & output.

FUNCTIONS OF FILE STEAM  CLASSES

1. filebuf     - sets the file buffers to read & write
               - contains close() & open() member functions
2. fstreambase - base class for fstream, ifstream & ofstream classes 
               - contains close() & open() member functions
3. ifstream    - provides input functions 
               - functions included are: get(), getline(), read()
               - seekg() & tellg() from istream class defined inside iostream.h
4. ofstream    - provides output functions
               - functions included are: put(), write()
               - seekp() & tellp() from ostream class defined inside iostream.h 
5. fstream     - input-output file stream class
               - inherits all the functions from istream & ostream classes through iostream defined inside iostream.h
