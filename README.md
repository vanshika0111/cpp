# <center> **OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING WITH C++** </center>
---
#### **DESCRIPTION**
---

A programming paradigm defines the methodology of designing & implementing programs using the key features & other building blocks of a programming language.
It gives an idea how problems are generally analysed & solved in a particular programming language.
Till date, there are three types of programming:
  1. Procedural Programming
  2. Object Based Programming
  3. Object Oriented Programming
  
For now, the main focus in on OOP. But, to understand what Object Oriented Programming is, let's first clear what Object Based Programming is.
Object Based Programming is a paradigm that implments some features of object oriented programming but not all.
Despite the advantages, it has a drawback of inability to represent real world relationships that exist among object.

The OOP is superset of object based programming.
It offers all the features of object based and overcomes its limitation by implementing inheritance.

#### **Object Oriented Programming Concepts**
---
Object-oriented approach views a problem in terms of objects involved rather than procedure for doing it.
It represents an entity that can store data & has its interface through functions.

The various concepts involved are **`class`**, **`object`**, **`dynamic binding`** & **`message passing`**.
The four pillars of OOP are **`Data abstraction`**, **`Encapsulation`**, **`Inheritance`** & **`Polymorphism`**.
